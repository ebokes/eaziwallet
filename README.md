   npm run build
   ```

5. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## 🧠 Design Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Architecture**: Utilizes a strictly component-based architecture for maximum modularity and reusability. Each component is self-contained, with logic, and tests colocated within its file or folder.
- **Mobile-First Layout**: Given the nature of fintech apps, I prioritized a mobile experience. The navigation switches from a Bottom Nav (mobile) to a Sidebar (desktop).
- **Client-Side Validation**: Implemented Zod schemas for immediate feedback, reducing server load and improving user experience.
- **Lazy Loading**: All main routes are lazy-loaded to optimize the critical rendering path and reduce initial load times.
- **Test Strategy**: Employs a **colocation strategy** where test files (`.test.tsx`, `.test.ts`) are placed directly next to the source files they verify, ensuring high visibility and easier maintenance.
- **Trade-off - Component Library**: Opted for custom components over a heavy library like MUI to maintain strict adherence to the premium design system and keep the bundle size low.

## 🔄 Porting to Another Framework

The application logic is heavily decoupled from the UI:

- **State Logic**: Most state management is handled through React hooks. Porting to **Vue** would involve converting these hooks to Composables.
- **Validation**: Zod is framework-agnostic, so the schemas can be reused 100% in any JavaScript framework.
- **Routing**: Moving to **Next.js** would involve moving files into the `app/` directory and replacing `react-router-dom` links with `next/link`.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. Complex Data Transformation for Grouped Lists

**Challenge**: Transforming a flat array of transactions into a grouped object keyed by relative dates (Today, Yesterday, and Older) presented logic hurdles. Initial implementations struggled with inconsistent date formats and timezone offsets.
**Solution**: I implemented a robust `groupTransactionsByDate` utility that leverages ISO date comparison. By normalizing the "Today" and "Yesterday" references at the start of the function, the logic accurately buckets transactions regardless of the user's local timezone, which is critical for a financial application.

### 2. Synchronizing Layout States with Dynamic Navigation

**Challenge**: The application uses a dual-navigation strategy: a `BottomNav` for mobile and a `Sidebar` for desktop. A major challenge was ensuring that sub-pages (like Transfer or Analytics) correctly hid these global navigation elements to maximize screen real estate, without breaking the nested route structure.
**Solution**: I implemented a centralized `Layout` component that monitors the current `location.pathname` against a `SHOW_NAV_PATHS` configuration. Combined with a custom `UiContext`, this allows the application to dynamically adjust layout padding and visibility of nav elements based on the depth of the user's navigation stack.

### 3. Integrating Zod Schemas with Custom Form Controls

**Challenge**: Binding custom UI components like the `PhoneInput` and a "Terms & Conditions" checkbox to `react-hook-form` while using strict Zod literals (e.g., `z.literal(true)`) was tricky. Simple boolean toggles often failed validation because they were passing values that technically met type requirements but failed the literal logic of the schema.
**Solution**: I refined the component interfaces to pass value events that strictly match the Zod schema's expectations. I also adjusted the form validation mode to `onSubmit` for better UX, ensuring that users aren't bombarded with error messages until they've actually attempted to proceed.
